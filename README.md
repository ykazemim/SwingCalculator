# SwingCalculator

This Java calculator application built with Swing provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.

It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with features like clearing, deleting, and decimal input. The code uses a GridBagLayout for flexible UI design. It's a simple yet effective tool for quick calculations.

Notably, the calculator processes only one operand at a time.

It was originally created as an assignment for Advanced Programming course at _Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)_.
